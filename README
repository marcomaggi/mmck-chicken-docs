1. Introduction
---------------

This project gathers unofficial documentation about the CHICKEN compiler
and  its development  environment.   CHICKEN is  a Scheme-to-C  compiler
supporting the language features as defined in the ``Revised^5 Report on
Scheme''.

  This package  targets POSIX systems.   To run the tests:  this package
depends upon the package MMCK Checks.

  The package uses the GNU Autotools  and it is tested, using Travis CI,
on both Ubuntu GNU+Linux systems and OS X systems.

  The last time the maintainer bothered to update this paragraph: he had
tested CHICKEN 5.0.0.


2. License
----------

See the individual documentation files for the copyright notices.


3. Install
----------

To install from a proper release tarball, do this:

    $ cd mmck-chicken-docs-0.1.0
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ ../configure
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

to inspect the available configuration options:

    $ ../configure --help

  The Makefile is designed to allow parallel builds, so we can do:

   $ make -j4 all && make -j4 check

which,  on  a  4-core  CPU,   should  speed  up  building  and  checking
significantly.

  The  Makefile supports  the  DESTDIR environment  variable to  install
files in a temporary location, example: to see what will happen:

    $ make -n install DESTDIR=/tmp/mmck-chicken-docs

to really do it:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/mmck-chicken-docs

  After the installation it is  possible to verify the installed library
against the test suite with:

    $ make installcheck

  From  a repository  checkout or  snapshot  (the ones  from the  GitHub
site): we must  install the GNU Autotools (GNU  Automake, GNU Autoconf),
then  we must  first run  the script  "autogen.sh" from  the top  source
directory, to generate the needed files:

    $ cd mmck-chicken-docs
    $ sh autogen.sh

  After this the  procedure is the same  as the one for  building from a
proper release tarball, but we have to enable maintainer mode:

    $ ../configure --enable-maintainer-mode [options]
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

  When compiling the environment  variable CHICKEN_FLAGS is available to
hand options to the compiler:

    $ make CHICKEN_FLAGS='-d3'


4. Usage
--------

Read the documentation generated from  the Texinfo sources.  The package
installs the documentation  in Info format; we can  generate and install
documentation in HTML format by running:

   $ make html
   $ make install-html


A. Credits
----------

The documentation was  gathered, and sometimes written,  by Marco Maggi.
If this package exists it's because of the great GNU software tools that
he uses  all the time.   CHICKEN was originally  a creation of  Felix L.
Winkelmann, it is now developed and maintained The CHICKEN Team.

  See the individual documentation files for the list of authors.


B. Bugs, vulnerabilities and contributions

D.1 Travis CI
-------------

Travis CI is  a hosted, distributed continuous  integration service used
to build and test software projects  hosted at GitHub.  We can find this
project's dashboard at:

	  <https://travis-ci.org/marcomaggi/mmck-chicken-docs>

Usage of this  service is configured through the  file `.travis.yml` and
additional scripts are under the directory `meta/travis-ci`.
